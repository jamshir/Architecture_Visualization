# Architecture_Visualization
Software Architecture Project

After unzipping the folder, the user needs to paste all the files generated by the DELDroid Tool in the “data” folder in the project. All the XML and CSV files need to be included in this folder.
A user should now configure and launch a local server on his/her machine and point to the main project folder called “Architecture_Visualization-master”.
In the browser, the user can simply choose the “src” folder to launch the application.

The Architecture of the System is represented in 2 separate views:
1. Application-level view
This view is implemented with a circle packing layout, to give the user a quick overview of how the system is structured
2. Component-level view
A more detailed, informative view that gives the user understanding of how each component interacts with other components and the types of attacks that are imposed due to some of these interactions.

***Implemented using D3.js library
